# 100 Days of ALXSE Coding Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of ALXSE Coding Challenge repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository contains code written during my 100 Days of ALXSE coding challenge. Throughout this journey, I'll be creating practical, reusable functions in different programming languages, revisiting fundamental programming concepts, and solving random challenges from platforms like Codewars, Hackerrank, and LeetCode.

## Structure

- `Day_X/`: Each day of the challenge will have its own folder, containing the code written on that day.
- `challenges/`: This directory stores solutions to the challenges from Codewars, Hackerrank, LeetCode, etc.
- `languages/`: Here, you'll find implementations of practical functions in various programming languages.

## Goal

My goal with this challenge is to improve my problem-solving skills, strengthen my understanding of programming concepts, and build a valuable portfolio of code.
