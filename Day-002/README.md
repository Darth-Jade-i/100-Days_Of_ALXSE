# DAY 002 - Thursday, 14th March 2024.
This directory contains codes I worked on for Day 2 of the challenge.
#
#
## FUNCTIONS
### Wrote code for functions that return the absolute value of a number in
Bash, C and in Python (the languages I know for now)
##
### j_abs.c
#### This was not too difficult to write but I realised that I would need to
     write two functions in this file. One for integer datatype and another for
     float datatype. Need to do more research so I can rewrite the code so that
     it can work for both datatypes so only one function will be written.
     ##### TODO:  Optimise the function so it will be a single function that
     	   	  works for both integer and float.
### jade.h
##
#### This is just the header file for all the C functions I will write
     So it will have my own header library at the end of the chalenge.
     this was basic for me as I'd written a lot of header files for ALXSE
     projects in the past 4 months.

### J_abs.sh
##
#### This was a bit tricky for me as I had not mastered bash scripting as yet.
     A little bit of snooping and using CHAtGPT to correct bits of erors in the
     code, I was able to write it. Opted to use the regular round brackets "()"
     over square brackets "[]" which allowed for the use of comparism symbols.


### j_abs.py
##
### Of the three, this was the easiest to write. It has fewer lines of code
    compared to the C program, and is the easiest to read. Did my best to keep
    it as plain as possible.

### In closing
##
##### There was downtime on the national internet grid today. As a result I
      couldn't do much work.
      It was nice writing the above codes. I easily saw how they differ and
      the logic in writing them as per the basics of  their syntaxe.
